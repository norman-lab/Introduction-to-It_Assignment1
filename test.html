    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <h4>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h4>
    <p>According to these tests, the company or the team can preliminarily understand my personal information. At the same time, he can also help the company to better arrange teammates in arranging team projects. Through the test, I can also show the company my own advantages, my personal characteristics and what I am good at. In addition, I can understand myself through tests.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h4>How do you think these results may influence your behavior in a team?</h4>
    <p>The results of these surveys will affect the company's judgment of me. First of all, everyone has different characteristics. Then, when communicating and assigning work, we should assign different tasks according to everyone's different characteristics. Their cooperation may cause problems and even affect the project itself, rather than making two people with different personalities a team. Therefore, in order to make the team more efficient. These tests are 1 necessary.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h4>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h4>
    <p>When we build a team, we need to make full use of everyone's characteristics. For example, people with strong organizational skills are leaders. At the same time, some people are not particularly good at communication and understanding, but they also have a strong ability to focus. When they are asked to work in the R &amp;amp; D department or study some profound problems, their role will expand infinitely. So at this time, we need some partners with strong communication skills and empathy to communicate among groups. At the same time, we also need some team members with strong discovery ability, innovation ability, and self reflection ability to help us understand ourselves and find our problems. Therefore, a team needs people with different personalities and characteristics to combine.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>For the different results and comparative analysis of each time, I can understand myself more accurately. I am an outgoing person. I am creative and can provide new ideas in group homework, but my shortcomings are also obvious. My interest in things lasts for a short time. Repeated and cumbersome work will make me lose interest quickly and lack patience with things, This is also something to pay attention to in future study.</p>
