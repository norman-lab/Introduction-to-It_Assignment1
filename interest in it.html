      <h2>My interest in it</h2>
      <h3><strong>1.What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?</strong></h3>
      <p>I think it is very meaningful and proud to write a program that can solve many problems and facilitate many people. First of all, the IT industry is currently one of the most mainstream industries in the world. Learning it means getting close to the world's mainstream technology and technology. At the same time, it is a new language and an exploration of the unknown world. When I was in junior high school, I couldn't afford to buy a computer at home. I can only understand the computer through the computer course of the school. When I completed a small computer program independently, I had a strong interest in it and made up my mind to learn it technology in the future. So my goal is to open my own software company in the future.</p>
      <h3>2.Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</h3>
      <p>Yes, the computer class and computer teacher in primary school stimulated my strong interest. At first, I just contacted some simple word document operations. Later, the use of PS made me more interested in computers. Later, I came into contact with some programming of Java and python, which fascinated me with the unknown exploration of computer language. </p>
      <h3>3.Why did you choose to come to RMIT? </h3>
      <p>RMIT is a famous international college. I like his open teaching environment and respect for the culture of international students. RMIT's computer courses are extensive and professional, and have strong teachers. At the same time, through the study of language courses, I came into contact with some RMIT learning atmosphere and learning mode. I think I can learn more knowledge here, which is very helpful for my future development. In addition, RMIT also helps students find internships, which is very helpful to me.</p>
      <h3>4.What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>
      <p>I hope that through my study in RMIT, I can learn not only the basic computer knowledge, but also the relevant knowledge of front-end and back-end development, database, multilingual programming and algorithm, and have a more practical and effective plan. Learn more practical programming skills and be able to use them skillfully. In this process, it is also very important to learn how to carry out team development and how to communicate programming with teammates.</p>
