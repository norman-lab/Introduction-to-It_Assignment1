      <p>ã€€My name is Yingjian Di. My nickname is Norman. My email is s3798345@student.rmit.edu.au. I come from northern China, where the climate is more comfortable and dry than Melbourne.<br>

Before coming to RMIT to study for a bachelor's degree, I had studied in a Chinese University for two years due to school cooperation. When I was very young, I was full of interest in the Internet and won the place in the computer competition in junior middle school. This is why I studied the subject of information technology after I went to college. Before coming here, I have some knowledge of HTML, Java, C and python programming languages. I hope to come to RMIT to learn more. I usually play computer games and exercise at a fixed time every week. I always go to the gym three times a week and often travel around the world.</p>
