      <h3><strong>Overview </strong></h3>
      <p>What I want to make here is a gym management system, which can help people manage fitness time, arrange fitness courses, conduct regular physical examination of the body, and make an appointment for the treadmill. The purpose of his creation is to better help people manage their own body. With the development of the times, people don't care about their own body more and more, Therefore, software is needed to help them manage their bodies. This may be a front-end and back-end together software, which is completed by rapid application development.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3><strong>Motivation</strong></h3>
      <p>As shown in the figure, with the increase of the number of gyms and the number of people in the profession of fitness coach, gym fitness has gradually become a part of people's life. There are more than 5000 gyms in Australia (2019), while there are 10810 gyms by 2021（<a href="https://mavenmarketing.com.au/list-of-gyms-and-health-clubs-in-australia/">Learn more</a>）. This only calculates the professional gyms, not the gyms brought by each apartment. Therefore, using gym management software to plan fitness is a convenient and time-saving way. At the same time, there is no other software on the market that integrates managing fitness time, managing body data and booking fitness courses, so the competitive pressure is not great, so making gym assistant software has a great prospect of profit. </p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3><strong>Description</strong></h3>
      <p>First of all, making this gym assistant software requires queuing software to make certain planning. We can divide the whole production process into four stages. In the first stage, we design the overall UI of the whole software, which is the basic part of the software. Here, we need to conduct a questionnaire survey on users' preferences, design the color and format of the UI through result comparison, and first make a rough UI drawing, This part is very important because it determines the overall orientation of the software. <br>
        The second stage is the preparation of the overall function of the software. The services provided by our software mainly include: appointment of fitness courses, management and analysis of body data, planning help for diet, and appointment function of treadmill. First of all, for the appointment of fitness courses, you can refer to the course selection mechanism. Each user can add fitness courses for themselves, and the coach will also be booked and choose to accept or reject the appointment. This saves time for both sides, solves possible problems in communication, and avoids the occurrence of users booking courses, coaches forgetting or users forgetting, Users and coaches will receive reminders of the course within 3 hours before the beginning of the course, and they also have sufficient time to cancel the course. The second function is body data management. We calculate the user's body data through the height, weight and other data entered by the user, model and analyze it, and help the user manage his body by comparing the last test results. If the gym has a professional test, the results will be more reference value. The third part is to provide suggestions for the user's diet. This part needs to analyze the user's body data model to give corresponding suggestions. For example, overweight people should appropriately reduce the intake of fat and carbohydrates. The fourth function is to help users make an appointment for the treadmill by installing a built-in program on the treadmill. The user can make an appointment for the treadmill in advance. The treadmill reserved by the user cannot be used by others. It can be started only by inputting the password known by the user. At the same time, the staff of the gym disinfect the treadmill reserved by the user in advance, This can prevent the user from using the treadmill, but there is no treadmill that can be used, and can also ensure the cleanness and hygiene of the treadmill used by the user. <br>
        The third stage code has been completed, and most of the functions of the software are realized. The code needs to be tested accordingly. The test needs to be conducted by multiple team members at the same time, including not only the rationality test of UI, but also the practicability test of function. At the same time, users are invited to use the software and give comments. <br>
      The fourth stage is to promote the software through communication with the gym. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3><strong>Tools and Technologies</strong></h3>
      <p>First of all, what we need most is rapid application development technology. We need to be proficient in Java programming and understand springboot related knowledge <br>
      Skillfully use IDEA for development. In terms of software, invison is used to design UI. If there is too much development data, corresponding SQL database needs to be established to save the data, and Navicat is used to design the database. And need some mathematical knowledge and logic. The gym is also needed to provide a treadmill for testing.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3><strong>Skills Required</strong></h3>
      <p>The required software includes: IDEA, SQL developer / navicats, vscade, invision, and a deployable server <br>
        Special hardware required: treadmill <br>
        Required abilities: advanced Java programming ability, database programming ability, user interface design ability, front and rear development knowledge, good logic and communication ability with people. <br>
      It also needs user groups that can help test. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3><strong>Outcome</strong></h3>
      <p>If the project is successful, for a fitness user, no matter where you are in Australia, you can complete the fitness course at any time, which will save a lot of time. At the same time, you can check whether your body is healthy at any time, so as to improve people's physical quality and make fewer people sick. This also solves the problem of fitness appointment and makes fitness easier, which may change the development route of gym in Australia and let intelligent fitness enter people's life.    </p>
